From Past to Present: An Analytical Overview of Singapore’s Parliamentary  Elections

In this report, I am expected to construct data visualizations using the datasets 
mentioned above, as well as any other relevant datasets from the ELD contained in 
data.gov.sg. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the history of 
Singapore’s parliamentary elections and an analysis of recent developments. I 
designed a range of visualizations, including those that incorporate election 
boundary data, to highlight significant events or trends.
